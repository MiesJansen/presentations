## What is Crystal?
Crystal is a platform for Sales & Trading to allow seamless workflows, scalable pricing/risk calculations and low latency execution.  

This presentation will focus on Crystal's workflow capabilities in the Securitization Market.

### Brief Background on Securitization Trading
* When you take a series of assets (like mortgages for example) and package them you are securitizing them.  For example:

Asset|Size($k)
:---:|:---:
Mortgage 1| 52
Mortgage 2 |  140
Mortgage 3 | 30
Mortgage 4 | 225
Mortgage ... |
Mortgage 5,000 | 126
Total | 1,000,000

After Securitization Becomes...

Liability|Size($mm)
:---:|:---:
Security A|500
Security B|350
Security C1|50
Security C2|50
Security R| 60
Total|1,010

An actual example:

After these securities are created they trade via:

1. Voice/email Auction: using an informal auction run by the seller called a Bid Wanted in Competition (BWIC). For example:

Id|Security Name|Of|Cf
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
A9484|Security A|500|140
B8374|Security D|200|30
A9023|Security C|325|325
A1739|Security Z|50|45

2. Private or Semi-Private B2B Trading: Email, Voice or Chat is the main mechanism

Together, these are called Over The Counter (OTC) trading because it is not on an exchange.

BWIC Workflow
Step #|Step|Today|Crystal v1
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
1|Client Sends BWIC to 1-40 Dealers|Email|Email
2|Trader anonymized and Forwards to Sales|Email|Crystal
3|Sales forwards to their client|Email|Email
4|Trader Analyzes securities<br>(asset history, <br>interest rate scenarios, <br>yield targets, etc...)|Spreadsheets/SQL|Crystal
5|Trader Adds Price Talk|Email|Crystal
6|Sales collected client feedback|Spreadsheet|Crystal
7|Trader Adds Final Bid|Spreadsheet|Crystal
8|Trader sends bids to seller|email|email

## Architecture/Technology Choices
* System Requirements
    * Performance
        * "Chat" <75ms response time
        * Analysis of 5mm assets x ~500 columns of data x 30 years of monthly history = ~15TB
        * Real time pivot (<75ms) of 2mm assets x 1 month = ~16GB
        * parallel stream upload of data from our clients
    * Customization
        * Clients specify the metadata for assets
    * Safety
        * Small startup
        * No room for bugs
    * Cost
        * need the flexibility to hire consultants for particular features and release them immediately

* MVP Architecture
    * Meteor (Node/Mongo|Galaxy/Atlas)
    * _from zero lines of code to production in 6 weeks_
* Crystal v1
    * How do we scale to the data requirements listed above?
    * we were confident mongo could scale, but what about the node server?

### Non-scientific comparison

Rust is the first language I've worked with where I am totally relaxed when I write code.  
* **Ownership:** The ownership model ensures minimum resource usage
* **Types:** Ultra strict typing ensures the vast majority of errors are caught at compile time

Other benefits:
* **Result/?:** easier to use than Try/Catch -- simple to pass types for specific errors
* **Option:** an absolute dream to work with. better than null or it's equivalents
* **Linking to other libraries:** cargo has all the modern package maintenance features.  coming from a c++ background thinks like `csv = { git = "https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-csv.git", rev = "d0642c500b7ea4b4e19d45aa19f10743063a3f57" }` are amazing.
* **Tests:** Test are trivial to add as they are built into the language.
* **.unwrap():** it is easy to filter for these and prevent them from getting into production code (forcing the developer to handle all cases unless it is just a test script)
* **functional style:** can easily manipulate data structures w/o loops
```rust
let product_id_fieldnames: Vec<&String> = product_metadata_map
        .product_id_fieldnames()
        .into_iter()
        .filter(|x|product_headers_map.contains_key(*x))
        .collect();
```
* **serde:** brilliant, fast, type safe parsing library
* **documentation:** docs.rs is spectacular for helping you find the package you need
* **Rust is Rust:** other languages drop into c or asm to achieve speed.  nearly all of ![alt text](https://www.rust-lang.org/logos/rust-logo-16x16.png) is written in ![alt text](https://www.rust-lang.org/logos/rust-logo-16x16.png)
* **const:** let is const by default

Things I try to avoid:
* **Arc's:** Not understanding how these worked caused a significant memory leak
* **bleeding edge libraries:** I initially tried (despite it being a prototype) using mongodb-labs/mongo-rust-driver-prototype.  It worked perfectly on windows and mac, but when we went to production on linux it was 40x slower!
